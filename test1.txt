“Empowering your right-side brain” – Increasing Creativity
Have you ever experienced a situation wherein you are trying to come up with something but your mind
 turns out all blank? You somehow wish that you’d be struck with a great idea or an innovative solution 
 to something, but then that never really turns real.  And eventually, you end up naming it  the “creative block”.
Creativity in the literal sense is the ability to come up with or recognize ideas to solve problems, 
communicate with others or entertain. It is all about finding new ways of solving something that isn’t 
restricted to worldly solutions only.
