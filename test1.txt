“Empowering your right-side brain” – Increasing Creativity
Have you ever experienced a situation wherein you are trying to come up with something but your mind
 turns out all blank? You somehow wish that you’d be struck with a great idea or an innovative solution 
 to something, but then that never really turns real.  And eventually, you end up naming it  the “creative block”.
Creativity in the literal sense is the ability to come up with or recognize ideas to solve problems, 
communicate with others or entertain. It is all about finding new ways of solving something that isn’t 
restricted to worldly solutions only. It is a useful skill but it is not necessary that you can find this
 in every person you come across or you know of. You can be creative without belonging to the creative 
 professional world but this might happen that even after belonging to that area you are less creative
  or not creative. Well, there’s never really  a straight line wherein we can put creative thinking.
