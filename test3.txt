1. Journal to the rescue: It is a very common yet established method of being 
a creative head. It is simple, therapeuticand can be done completely in private.
 Not only does it help in improving your levels of concentration but channelises
  your creativity level like nothing else. Research shows that the physical act 
  of writing, which requires you to carry out sequential strokes by hand, actively 
  engages your brain, which can improve your levels of concentration and creativity.
   It fuels your brain to function optimally and think from outside the box. 
   It sounds so simple, and yet in this era of information overload and highly 
   charged urban life, this important element is often missing from our everyday lives.
