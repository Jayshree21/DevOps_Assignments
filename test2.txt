Creativity in the literal sense is the ability to come up with or recognize ideas to solve problems, communicate with others or entertain. It is all about finding new ways of solving something that isn’t restricted to worldly solutions only. It is a useful skill but it is not necessary that you can find this in every person you come across or you know of. You can be creative without belonging to the creative professional world but this might happen that even after belonging to that area you are less creative or not creative. Well, there’s never really a straight line wherein we can put creative thinking.
