SDLC -

It is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares.

SDLC's full form is Software Development Life Cycle and is also known software development process.
It is nothing but a standard practice which is followed within an organisation to make the project successful. It consist of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.
There are certain processes which SDLC contains. These are:

2. Defining Requirements: This is the process of making an SRS which is Software Requirement Specification.
