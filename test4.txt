2. Ignite mind-body connection:. Focus on things that give you new perspectives,
 and new horizons to think about. Brainstorm on refining your ideas and eradicating 
 roadblocks. Creativity isn’t just about thinking outside the box; make the most of 
 that mind-body connection and throw the whole box away. Do not process everything 
 at once, make small chunks, do something different, challenge your brain to do 
 something that you’ve never done, and then see the results. Always understand,
  that giving an open out to things will always give you results.
