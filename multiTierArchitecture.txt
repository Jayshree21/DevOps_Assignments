Multi Tier Architecture is a client-server
architecture in which presentation, application processing
and data management functions are physically seperated.

Three-Tier Architecture.

   tier. This tier controls the whole logic of the application.

3. Data Tier: It is the database layer which deals with all the data persistence mechanisms.
